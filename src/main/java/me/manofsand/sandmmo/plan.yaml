Document Plan for Creating a Minecraft MMO Plugin (SandMMO)

1. Overview:
   - Develop a plugin similar to mmocore using the Spigot API.
   - Integrate MythicMobs for advanced enemy and boss behaviors.
   - Leverage the Eco API for in-game economy features.
   - Utilize the Adventure library with MiniMessage for rich, interactive messages.
   - Ensure high performance and compatibility with Java 21.

2. Plugin Architecture:
   - Main class (SandMMO) extending JavaPlugin.
   - Modular design with dedicated managers for:
       • Player Data & Progression
       • Skills and Abilities
       • Combat Mechanics
       • Economy & Transactions
       • Quest and Event Management
       • MythicMobs Integration

3. Core Features:
   a. Player Data Management:
       - Persistent storage for stats, experience, levels, and skills.
       - In-memory caching and asynchronous data saving.
   b. Skills & Abilities:
       - Dynamic skill system with cooldowns and level-based progression.
       - Class/job-specific skill trees.
   c. Combat System:
       - Custom damage calculations and effects.
       - Integration with MythicMobs for custom enemy behaviors.
   d. Economy:
       - Secure transactions, rewards, and in-game currency using the Eco API.
       - Configurable shops and economy balances.
   e. Quest & Progression System:
       - Daily/weekly quests, achievements, and reward systems.
       - Progression tracking and event triggers.
   f. Messaging & UI:
       - Use the Adventure library with MiniMessage for interactive, localizable messaging.
       - Customizable alerts, notifications, and in-game prompts.

4. Performance Optimization:
   - Utilize asynchronous processing for heavy computations and data storage.
   - Optimize event handling to minimize overhead.
   - Leverage Java 21 features for enhanced performance.

5. Extensibility & API:
   - Expose a robust API for future plugins and feature expansions.
   - Document hooks and events for developers to integrate additional functionalities.

6. Testing & Documentation:
   - Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests.
   - Maintain detailed Javadoc and developer guides.
   - Use Maven for dependency management and build processes.
